It effectively understood the context of my course, offered some solid ideas for a project on heart diseases, and provided helpful guidance for planning. However, when it came to datasets, the provided links were often either non-functional or too detailed for my specific needs. Improved recommendations for code modifications and simpler, more functional datasets would have been more beneficial. Overall, the responses were helpful, but they could have been more valuable with more precise links to relevant resources and datasets."
